        <h3><a id="welcome-to-apptanium-mail" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-apptanium-mail" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to apptanium mail</h3>

          <p>
              Email is awful. The protocols that underpin email today are wholly deficient for the needs that email-like systems should fulfil.
          </p>

          <p>
              The apptanium-mail project is an effort to reimagine email for the new era of the always-on, always-connected world.
          </p>

          <p>
              Apptanium-mail aims to create a new, open platform for mail that focuses on modern messaging and communication workflows.
              The primary goals of a relevant messaging system are:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>In-grained security</strong>: the messaging system should seamlessly use a key exchange system between two parties to guarantee security and integrity of the message in transit</li>
                <li><strong>Identity</strong>: email addresses have become de-facto unique identifiers for individuals on the internet.
                    A modern mail system should provide strong identity services so that one's email address is usable as a universal identifier instead of being brokered via other services</li>
                <li><strong>Trust</strong>: to complement identity services, the email system should also provide an infrastructure of trust services by providing access to message verification, etc.
                    A mail system that embodies trust and identity intrinsically has the following benefits:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prevent Phishing attacks and spam</li>
                        <li>Effective blocking from email subscription lists</li>
                        <li>A comprehensive handshaking process between two parties to seamlessly ensure secure, trusted communications</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Social</strong>: the system allows social graph connections from other email systems following the ng-mail protocol. For instance, user alice@abc.com with a server on one system should be able to establish a social graph connection with user bob@bcd.com on another server.</li>
                <li><strong>Apps and APIs</strong>: the messaging system should be built to natively handle connections from apps and through APIs. Utilization of techniques like OAuth, etc. should be used to facilitate this functionality.
                    The system should also allow the incorporation of various plugins to enhance core functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Auditing</strong>: provide blockchain based audit trails to enable strong auditing of email systems where such compliance is required</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Deployment Options</strong>: the server system should be compatible with modern cloud-centric technologies, such as containers, etc. so that
                    installations can be managed, secured, and maintained with greater ease.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h3>

          <p>
              Just as current mail servers are installed on a company's servers, or on a hosting platform in a multi-tenant environment, the ng-mail server
              can be installed on-premises by a company or an enthusiast, and can also be operated by a hosting platform in a multi-tenant environment.

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
